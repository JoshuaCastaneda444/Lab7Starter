1. I think "1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed" is most appropriate. People are lazy, I am lazy. I know that if I can't depend on myself to consistently run these tests I know I can't depend on someone else to do so. Implementing them within a github action will make sure that at each small change (or at least the commits *should* be small), nothing breaks.
